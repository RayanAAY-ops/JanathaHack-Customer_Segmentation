# JanathaHack-Customer_Segmentation
Max voting of 4 Optimized Classifiers based on decision tree algorithms.

This is my implementation of the JanathaHack Customer Segmentation Algorithm.

I increased the number of variable by using K-means clustering over numerical values to add complexity.


I used 4 differents optimized Decision Tree Algorithm : 
  -Xgboost
  
  -GradientBoosting
  
  -Random Forest
  
  -ExtraTree
  
  
Final score :83% accuracy
